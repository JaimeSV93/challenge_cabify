# README

## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation for the challenge. It includes two main parts: the **experiment design for JustEat** and the **model prototyping**. Both parts are thoroughly explained and demonstrated within the provided Jupyter notebook.

All the files are packaged in a **.zip archive**. You will need to extract the contents of the archive before proceeding with the instructions below.

## Repository Contents

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains detailed explanations and code for both parts of the challenge:
  1. **Experiment Design** for JustEat: Step-by-step breakdown of the experimental setup and methodology.
  2. **Model Prototyping**: Explanation and implementation of the machine learning model.
  
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for the challenge. (Assumed to be the one provided as part of the project.)
  
- **main.py**: This file contains the full implementation of the machine learning model code from the **model prototyping** section. You can run this file to execute the model.

## How to Use

1. **Extract the .zip file** containing the repository contents.
2. Open the **Jupyter Notebook** to follow along with the explanations and code for the challenge.
3. To execute the machine learning model, simply run the **main.py** file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
